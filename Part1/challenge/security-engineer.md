## Cybersecurity Problem Solver

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Security Engineer assessment at CloudWalk! This challenge is designed to evaluate your data analysis skills, logical thinking, and ability to identify and mitigate security risks. We are eager to see your creativity and innovative solutions to real-world security problems.


## 2. Challenge Objective
Your task is to analyze a provided set of network traffic data to identify potential security risks and develop a policy to mitigate or prevent these risks. We want you to demonstrate a thorough analysis of the data, logical reasoning in risk identification, and a clear approach to implementing effective security measures.


## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Data Analysis
Thoroughly analyze the provided network traffic data. Identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security risks. Clearly document your analysis process and findings.
### 3.2. Risk Identification and Policy Development
Based on your analysis and knowledge, identify potential security risks and develop a comprehensive security policy to mitigate or prevent these risks. Explain your logic behind the policy and how it addresses the identified risks.
### 3.3. Implementation
Implement a solution that enforces the security policy. This can be in the form of a script or program that simulates how the policy would assess and filter network traffic. Ensure your implementation is adaptable to various traffic patterns.
### 3.4. Explanation and Documentation
Provide a clear explanation of your approach, including how you analyzed the data, identified risks, and developed the security policy. Make sure to highlight your logical thinking and innovative solutions.
